# Conventions

Service conventions are common concepts and features that are shared among
all services in Qlik Core.

We currently have the following conventions:

Convention                          | Description
----------------------------------- | -----------
[API Strategy](./api-strategy.md)   | API versioning and deprecation.
[Logging](./logging.md)             | Service event logging.
[Metrics](./metrics.md)             | Run-time metadata and how to expose it.
