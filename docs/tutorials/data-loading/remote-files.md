# Remote files

This tutorial gives an example of how to load data from remote files into Qlik Associative Engine using the built-in
web file connectivity. In this example files are located on Dropbox but the solution would be similar if using,
for example, Google Drive or OneDrive.

## Prerequisites

To follow along in this tutorial, you should have basic understanding of Docker.

You need the following software installed:

* Git
* Docker
* docker-compose
* Node.js

!!! Note
    Shell commands should be run in a Bash shell.
    If you are using Windows, we recommend using Git Bash.

## The file connectivity service

The File Connectivity Service is an example of a service that can be used to load data from remote files in a Qlik Core
stack. This service can be configured to provide built-in data connectivity to connect to
[OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)-protected data sources like Dropbox, OneDrive, and GoogleDrive.

The data connection service that is used in this tutorial works by defining a unique HTTP endpoint for each registered
connection provider. The Qlik Associative Engine can then access different data sources by making calls to the
service-defined HTTP endpoints.

## Setup

To run the example code, clone the
[qlik-oss/core-file-connectivity-service](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-file-connectivity-service) Git repository.
Check out the repo documentation to get familiar with the content and structure.

In your shell, make sure current directory is at the repo root. Then, install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Next, copy the [data/airports.csv](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-file-connectivity-service/blob/master/data/airports.csv)
file into your Dropbox root folder.

You will now need to create an OAuth2.0 application by following the Dropbox
[OAuth guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/oauth-guide). Find the _App key_ and _App secret_.
These are needed in the next steps.

!!! Note
    When you create your application, the `Redirect URI` should be the address of the callback that is running the
    service: `http://[host]:[port]/oauth2/callback`. For example: `http://localhost:3000/v1/oauth2/callback`

Start the Docker container by setting `ACCEPT_EULA`, `DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID`, and `DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET` as applicable
and run:

```sh
cd examples

ACCEPT_EULA=<yes/no> \
DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID=<Dropbox App key> \
DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET=<Dropbox App secret> \
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Loading data from Dropbox

Once the previous setup steps have been completed, everything is prepared to actually load data from the file located on
Dropbox.

```sh
node dropbox.js
```

The expected output is that 10 airport entries from the
[airports.csv](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-file-connectivity-service/blob/master/data/airports.csv) file is printed
to the console window.
