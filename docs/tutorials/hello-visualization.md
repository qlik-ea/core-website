# Hello Visualization

This example shows how to visualize data in a QIX Engine running inside a Docker container. It extends the
[Hello Data](./hello-data.md) example.

[picasso.js](https://github.com/qlik-ea/picasso.js) is used to build the visualization. picasso.js is a charting library
streamlined for building visualizations with Frontira.

As in the Hello Data example, [enigma.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/enigma.js) is used to communicate with QIX
Engine and [halyard.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/halyard.js) is used to load data into QIX Engine.

## GitHub Repository

The Hello Visualization example is located on [GitHub](https://github.com/qlik-ea/getting-started-with-web-platform).

When running this example, it is assumed that the repository is cloned to the local machine and that commands and
actions are performed in that repository.

## Start QIX Engine

Unless QIX Engine is already running from the [Hello Data](./hello-data.md) example, start it with with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This makes the same movie data available to QIX Engine as in the [Hello Data](./hello-data.md) example.

## Load and Visualize Data

This example uses [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [picasso.js](https://github.com/qlik-ea/picasso.js)
to create a simple web application with visualization of movie data.

In [app.js](https://github.com/qlik-ea/getting-started-with-web-platform/blob/master/src/hello-visualization/app.js)
information about _what_ data to load and _where_ to fetch the data is put into
[halyard.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/halyard.js). This information is then used to create and populate a session app
in QIX Engine using [enigma.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/enigma.js) and
[halyard.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/halyard.js). A session app only lives as long as the session is alive.

The visualization is created in [scatterplot.js](src/scatterplot.js).

Install the dependencies (see [package.json](https://github.com/qlik-ea/getting-started-with-web-platform/blob/master/package.json))
and run the app with:

```bash
npm install
npm run hello-visualization
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the movies in the scatter plot.
Observe how a movie can be selected to bring up more information about it.

Study the
[app.js](https://github.com/qlik-ea/getting-started-with-web-platform/blob/master/src/hello-visualization/app.js) file
and observe how enigma.js and halyard.js are used to load and retrive the movies data with QIX Engine.

Study the
[scatterplot.js](https://github.com/qlik-ea/getting-started-with-web-platform/blob/master/src/hello-visualization/app.js)
file and observe how picasso.js is used to render a scatter plot from data retrieved from QIX Engine.

## Next Steps

In this example, it was shown how to load and visualize data with QIX Engine and picasso.js.

A recommended next step is to explore the [Core](./core.md) tutorial, which shows how to run all core services of
Frontira together. This will cover important topics such as how to run several QIX Engine instances using
different container orchestration platforms.

It is also recommended to get a closer look at [enigma.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/enigma.js),
[halyard.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/enigma.js), [picasso.js](https://github.com/qlik-ea/picasso.js)
and the full range of features in these libraries.
