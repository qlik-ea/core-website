# Data Loading

Start loading data into your document by working through a data load workflow using OAuth2.0 or the gRPC protocol.

## Prerequisites

To follow along in this tutorial, you should have basic understanding of Docker.

!!! Note
    In the examples that follow, all shell commands should be run in a Bash shell.
    If you are using Windows, we recommend using Git Bash.

## Loading data from PostgreSQL database with JDBC

In this example workflow, load data from a PostgreSQL database
using the gRPC protocol in the Qlik Associative Engine.

Before you start this example, you must clone the [core-grpc-jdbc-connector](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-grpc-jdbc-connector)
Git repository to your local machine.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-grpc-jdbc-connector.git
```

Do the following:

1. Start the containers.

    ```bash
    cd example/
    ACCEPT_EULA=<yes/no> docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

    The [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-grpc-jdbc-connector/blob/master/example/docker-compose.yml)
    file starts the following services in containers:

    - A mySQL database
    - A postgreSQL database
    - A core-grpc-jdbc-connector
    - The Qlik Associative Engine

    **Note:** If you look at the `docker-compose.yml` file, port `9076` on the container
    is mapped to port `19076` on the local machine.
    This lets you access the Qlik Associative Engine from outside of the Docker network.
    In this example, we want to trigger a load of the airport data
    from outside of the container.

    The following special commands are important for enabling the gRPC connectors:

    - `-S EnableGrpcCustomConnectors=1`

        Enables gRPC connectors in the Qlik Associative Engine.

    - `-S GrpcConnectorPlugins="jdbc,jdbc-connector:50051"`

        Registers a connector of the type `jdbc`,
        which we tell the Qlik Associative Engine exists on host `jdbc-connector`
        and listening on port `50051`.

1. Verify that the three services are running in containers.

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

    The postgres-database containers share port `5432` and the mysql-database containers share port `3306`,
    they are both exposed on the network.
    The `jdbc-connector` can therefore access the database container on this port.

    The `jdbc-connector` container exposes port `50051`.
    This is the port that we told the Qlik Associative Engine to talk to
    with the commands in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

    The Qlik Associative Engine exposes ports `9076` and `9090`.
    Port `9090` is used for metrics, which is not relevant for this example.
    Port `9076` is the standard Qlik Associative Engine API port. Since we mapped it to
    port `19076` on your local machine, _outside_ of the container,
    requests to your machine on port `19076` will go to Qlik Associative Engine container.

1. Trigger the data load.

    Now that we have a populated database, a gRPC connector container,
    and a Qlik Associative Engine running, all we need is to trigger a load of the data.

    For this example, a small Node.js program that uses the Qlik library [enigma.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/enigma.js)
    that talks to the Qlik Associative Engine triggers a load of the airport data with the gRPC connector.

    ```bash
    cd reload-runner
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

    You should see the 100 rows of airport data fetched from MySQL and an additional 100 rows of data
    fetched from PostgreSQL in your terminal.

## What is happening

Once the containers are running and you trigger the reload,
the program creates and opens an app called `reloadapp.qvf` on the Qlik Associative Engine.
Then it creates a connection of the type we defined earlier.

```js
app.createConnection({
  qType: 'jdbc', // the name we defined as a parameter to engine in our docker-compose.yml
  qName: 'jdbc',
  qConnectionString:
   'CUSTOM CONNECT TO "provider=jdbc;driver=postgresql;host=postgres-database;port=5432;database=postgres"', // the connection string includes both the provide to use and parameters to it.
  qUserName: 'postgres', // username and password for the postgres database, provided to the GRPC-Connector
  qPassword: 'postgres',
});
```

**qType** represents what type of connector the connection should use.

**qName** is the name of this connection instance.

**qConnectionString** is the parameter that is sent to the connector.
The parts of the connection string that is specific to the JDBC connector is the driver setting.
It will be the JDBC driver that the connector will use to connect to the database with.
The provider needs to be the same as the qType. Host, port and database are related to locating the database.

**qUserName** and **qPassword** are the credentials used to access the database with (will be removed from the logs).

Then, we set a script to use the connection that we just created.

```js
const script = `
   lib connect to 'jdbc';
   airports:
   sql SELECT * FROM airports;
   `; // add script to use the jdbc connector and load a table
app.setScript(script);
```

The "lib connect to 'jdbc';" refers to the name of the connection to use.
"airports:" will be the internal name of the table loaded.
The actual load statement that is sent to the connector is everything after sql.
In this case the load statement will be "SELECT * FROM airports".

Next, we reload the data to load the new data into the Qlik Associative Engine.
The first 100 results of the `airports` table loaded from PostgreSQL are print to the console.

The workflow is then repeated a second time with only change being that we use a new connection
to the MySQL database container.

```js
app.createConnection({
  qType: 'jdbc', // the name we defined as a parameter to Qlik Associative Engine in our docker-compose.yml
  qName: 'jdbc',
  qConnectionString:
  'CUSTOM CONNECT TO "provider=jdbc;driver=mysql;host=mysql-database;port=3306;database=airport"', // the connection string includes both the provider to use and parameters to it.
  qUserName: 'root', // username and password for the postgres database, provided to the GRPC-Connector
  qPassword: 'mysecretpassword',
});
```

The biggest difference between the connection strings are the driver setting that is using
the JDBC driver for mysql instead of postgresql.

The first 100 results of the `airports` table loaded from MySQL are print to the console.

!!! Tip
    We recommend that you take a look inside the `index.js` file
    and that you read through the [enigma.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/enigma.js) documentation
    to get a better understanding of the steps taken in this tutorial.

## Accessing data through a connection service

Learn how you can connect to an [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)-protected data source
using the _example_ data-connection service to retrieve and load data.

### File connectivity service

The File Connectivity Service is an example of a service that can be used to load data from
remote files in a Qlik Core stack.
This service can be configured to provide built-in data connectivity to connect to
[OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)-protected data sources
like Dropbox, OneDrive, and GoogleDrive.

The data connection service that is used in this tutorial
works by defining a unique HTTP endpoint for each registered connection provider.
The Qlik Associative Engine can then access different data sources by making calls
to the service-defined HTTP endpoints.

Before you start this example, you must clone the
[File Connectivity Service](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-file-connectivity-service)
Git repository to your local machine.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-file-connectivity-service.git
```

### Dropbox example

Do the following:

1. Install the dependencies.
    ``` bash
    cd core-file-connectivity-service
    npm install
    ```
1. Copy the [`airports.csv`](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-file-connectivity-service/blob/master/data/airports.csv)
    file, which is located in the `/data` folder of the `core-file-connectivity-service` repository, and paste
    it into your Dropbox.
1. Create an OAuth2.0 application by following the
    [OAuth guide instructions](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/oauth-guide).

    **Note:** When you create your application, the `Redirect URI`
    should be the address of the callback that is running the service: `http://[host]:[port]/oauth2/callback`.
    For example: `http://localhost:3000/v1/oauth2/callback`

1. Start the Docker container, ensure that you set the proper
    credentials in the environment variables prefixing the
    multi-lined `docker-compose` command below.
    ```bash
    cd examples
    ACCEPT_EULA=yes \
    DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID="your App key" \
    DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET="your App secret" \
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
1. Run the `dropbox.js` application.
    ```bash
    node dropbox.js
    ```
    It should output the 10 lines of the [`airports.csv`](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-file-connectivity-service/blob/master/data/airports.csv)
        to the console window.

The workflow for loading data from GoogleDrive and OneDrive is similar to the example above,
and loading data from these data sources is supported by the
[File Connectivity Service](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-file-connectivity-service).
