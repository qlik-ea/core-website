# Newspaper website

Frontira can be used in many different ways and each implementation will be unique,
but the concepts and solutions in this use case provide useful information when building your solution.

In this scenario, documents are hosted as a backend with a custom-built user interface
that is embedded in the newspaper site for storytelling and interactive charts.

In this type of deployment, there are typically bursts in traffic volume for specific documents
as users click through content or as they make selections in an interactive chart.
This type of deployment must be able to handle a reasonable uptake of traffic
against a discrete amount of documents or data models.

## Assumptions

There are several assumptions that are made in this example.

- __Web usage pattern__

    User traffic to the website
    and the load incurred by the Frontira backend fluctuates across timezones.
    For example, as traffic from users in American timezones declines,
    traffic from users in European timezones increases.

- __Document entities__

    There are a few distinct document entities with known sizes and characteristics.

- __Hosts/nodes__

    There is a predefined set of hosts/nodes running QIX Engine.
    If unused, they are idling awaiting workload.

- __Loading QIX Engine nodes__

    It is expected that documents can be loaded on all of the QIX Engine nodes,
    or that the nodes are pre-populated with the documents.

    Having the documents already loaded on the QIX Engine nodes
    would improve speed and removes the need to continuously check whether there is enough resource
    headroom.

**Note:** In this scenario, there is no logic to reject new sessions
even if the current cluster is fully loaded or overloaded. This type of feature could be
implemented by checking for headroom and rejecting sessions when there is not enough left.

## Document session placement using Mira

Given the assumptions specified above,
RAM and CPU are important metrics for
determining how to scale the system and where to place new sessions.

New sessions should be placed on the QIX Engine node that has the most headroom and least amount of load.
A simple least-load principle could be applied to
properly place a new user on the appropriate QIX Engine node.

You can do this by using the [Mira service](./../../documentation/services/mira.md) to return an array
of available QIX Engine instances and then sort them by load.

**Note:** In this scenario, it is assumed that the document is either already open or small
enough to not cause RAM issues.

A document session placement algorithm does the following:

- Get QIX Engine instances from Mira and sort them by least load.
- Sort the QIX Engine instances by the most free RAM.
- If multiple QIX Engines have the same amount of free RAM,
    then sort the QIX Engine instances by CPU consumption.
- Choose the QIX Engine instance with the least amount of load (RAM and CPU).

```javascript
//RAM free takes priority, but if equal then CPU is the deciding factor
function compareResources(a, b) {
  if (a.engine.health.mem.free > b.engine.health.mem.free) {
    return -1;
  }
  if (a.engine.health.mem.free < b.engine.health.mem.free) {
    return 1;
  }
  if (a.engine.health.cpu.total < b.engine.health.cpu.total){
    return -1;
  } else {
    return 1;
  }
}

function getLeastLoadedQixEngine() {
  const qixEngines = []; // retrieved from your Mira service
  var sortedQIXEngines = qixEngines.sort(compareResources);
  console.log("QIX Engine selected: "+ sortedQIXEngines[0].engine.ip);
  return sortedQIXEngines[0].engine.ip;
}
```
