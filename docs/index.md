Welcome to Qlik Core Beta! This beta program gives you early access to Qlik Core, our brand-new plug-and-play
developer platform for custom analytics that lets you drop the Qlik Associative Engine into your systems today
– and act on your insight tomorrow.

As you’re aware, beta versions are subject to being less stable than the final version officially released
to the general public. Therefore, should you decide to participate in this beta program, we do not recommend
you run your existing production workloads using Qlik Core.

If you have questions about Qlik Core Beta use our [Slack channels](http://branch.qlik.com/slack).
We would love to get your feedback, how you are using Qlik Core Beta and what we can to do make it better.

## What is Qlik Core?

Qlik Core is a development platform built on top of the Qlik Associative Engine.
With Qlik Core, you can take advantage of the powerful associative indexing engine from Qlik
to build your custom data exploration and data vizualization solutions.

The Qlik Associative Engine differentiates from other vendors by dynamically calculating and providing associations
based on data selections, without needing to rely on query-based analyses which are restricted to linear exploration
within a partial view of the data.

## Open Source

We believe in Open Source! Much in Qlik Core is developed as Open Source.
We encourage you to explore the different git repositories, _star_ your favorite repositories, file issues, and send
pull requests.

We are on GitHub at [Qlik - Open Source Software](https://github.com/qlik-oss/).

## Containers

Qlik Core is designed to take advantage of the power of container-based solutions and microservice architectures, such as
[Docker](https://docker.com).

The Qlik Associative Engine on Linux, provided as a Docker image, forms the foundation of this.

Developers building their solutions on Qlik Core are provided with a large range of powerful technologies, for example
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), which enables container orchestration and elastic scaling of multiple Qlik
Associative Engine instances in distributed environments.

## Live Demo

To see an example of what can be built using Qlik Core, a live demo is available at
[ap.qlikcore.com](https://ap.qlikcore.com).

The demo is built on the requirements from a fictive company, which provides an interactive application to
assist doctors with drug prescriptions.

The source code for the demo, including more detailed documentation, is available as open source on GitHub
in the [qlik-oss/core-assisted-prescription](https://github.com/qlik-oss/core-assisted-prescription) repository.

## New to Qlik Core?

If you are new to Qlik Core, we recommend that you begin with the [Getting Started](./docs/get-started.md) section.
