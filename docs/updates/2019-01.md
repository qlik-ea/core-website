# January 2019

New year, new features, new solutions. Welcome to the first Qlik Core update of 2019! There are a couple of important
changes and improvements which we hope you will like.

## ABAC moving from experimental to stable

The [Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)](../../services/qix-engine/access-control/) API has been part of Qlik Core
since the public beta launch as an [experimental API](../../conventions/api-strategy/#stability-index), but we believe
it to be robust and battle-tested enough to provide it to a wider audience. The status will change in the next Engine
API release on February 8, 2019.

**If you are already using the ABAC feature: With the move to stable, there is a change in how apps are persisted.
If you are currently using ABAC, you will need to [re-import those QVF files using the REST API](../../services/qix-engine/access-control/#adding-an-existing-app).**

Any application created or imported on an Engine with ABAC enabled prior to this change will stop working.

If you have programmatically created the application, this shouldn't be a problem since you can just recreate the
application in the new Engine. However, if you have manually added objects, we suggest exporting them before upgrading
to the new Engine.

For those of you running the license service, you can stay on an Engine version until you have made the change but we
urge you to take the necessary steps to enable it for future Engine upgrades.

The reason for the change is that the new persistence mode significantly reduces the risk for app corruptions and
allows for better write concurrency.

## Data model experience

Our data modeling tool, catwalk, has reached a maturity level where we feel comfortable moving it from experimental
to stable. Since it has been continuously updated on [catwalk.core.qlik.com](https://catwalk.core.qlik.com)
you will already feel familiar with the look and feel if you've used it before but here are some of its latest
additions:

### Tool walk-through

The first time you enter the tool you will be greeted with a guide walking you through the different parts of the
application. The guide will describe how you can analyze your data model, how to interpret the different colors and
association lines, and what the numbers mean.

The guide is based on your chosen application. If you would like to pull it up again in the future, you can do so by
right clicking on the catwalk logo located at the top right of the application.

### More field descriptions

Another feature we added to provide a better understanding of the data model is extended field information. Previously,
you could only reach field information by hoovering over the field card to view a condensed version of the field
data. With the new feature you can also click on the three dots in the top right corner of a field to get a more
descriptive information card with an explanation.

## Improvements in the corectl tool

Our CLI tool corectl has not been forgotten this month and received small improvements such as:

* Ability to print event messages in verbose mode
* Ability to set a free text connection string when configuring a connector
* Better error messages when working with an Engine without a correct license (no license and Engine has expired)

## Upcoming

In February 2019, we will focus on moving corectl from the experimental state to a 1.0.0 release. Stay tuned!
