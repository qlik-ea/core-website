# November 2018

In this November 2018 update we would like to highlight a number of updates in [Catwalk](https://github.com/qlik-oss/catwalk) and [corectl](https://github.com/qlik-oss/corectl).

## Data model experience

In our quest to improve the data modelling experience for Qlik Core developers, we have continued to work on the
[catwalk](https://github.com/qlik-oss/catwalk) project. Some of the things we have been working with:

* A list of available documents in an engine if no app is addressed.
* Color coded field associations based on key type (primary, foreign and perfect).
* Filterbox supporting the Qlik green-white-gray selection paradigm.
* List of available dimensions and measures.
* Additional information about tables and fields in tooltips.
* Improved stability with bug fixes.

Check it out at [catwalk.core.qlik.com](https://catwalk.core.qlik.com), where Catwalk is continously deployed.

## Command structure in corectl

With a growing number of features in corectl, the top level command structure became complex which made it hard to get an
good overview of the capabilities. To address this, we have made a complete overhaul and gathered high level commands
like build, eval and get on top level, and added the details in sub commands.

As an example, getting a list of object can be done by:

```qlik
corectl get objects
```

and setting a reload script:

```qlik
corectl set script loadscript.qvs
```

Keep yourself updated by looking for the latest releases in:
[corectl](https://github.com/qlik-oss/corectl)

## Reload log output

With the new engine version XXX we added support for logging script reloads to std::out instead of only storing the data
log in the engine container.

## Upcoming

In the upcoming month we will continue hardening our data loading tool corectl. Stay tuned and join the conversation in:
