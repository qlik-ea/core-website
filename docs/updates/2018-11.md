# November 2018

In this November 2018 update we would like to highlight a number of significant features and updates we hope you would
like.

## Improving the data model experience

In our quest to improve the data modelling experience for Qlik Core developers, we have continued working on our
[catwalk](https://github.com/qlik-oss/catwalk) project and arrived at a first release. Even though it is a 1.0.0 version
it is fully packed with features and should support the most common use cases.

Amongst the new features you will find:

* A list of all available documents in an engine if no app is addressed
* Color coded field associations based on key type (primary, foreign and perfect)
* Filterbox supporting the Qlik green-white-gray selection paradigm
* List of available dimensions and measures
* Additional information about tables and fields in tooltips

More information can be found on:

* [Use case]()
* [Documentation]()

## Refactor command structure in corectl

With a growing number of features in corectl the top level command structure grew in complexity making it hard to get a
good overview of the capabilities. To address this we have done a complete overhaul and gathered high level commands
like build, eval, get on top level, adding the details in sub commands.

As an example getting a list of object can be done by:

```qlik
corectl get objects
```

and seting a reload script:

```qlik
corectl set script loadscript.qvs
```

Keep yourself updated by looking for the latest releases in:
[corectl](https://github.com/qlik-oss/corectl)

## Reload log output

With the new engine version XXX we added support for logging script reloads to std::out instead of only storing the data
log in the engine container.

## Coming up

In the coming month we will continue hardening our data loading tool corectl. Stay tuned and join the conversation in:
