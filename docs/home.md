## What is Qlik Core?

Qlik Core provides a development platform for building custom data exploration and data
visualization solutions on top of QIX Engine, the powerful associative indexing engine from Qlik.

QIX Engine differentiates from other vendors by dynamically calculating and providing associations based on data
selections, without the need to rely on query-based analysis which restricts to linear exploration within a partial view
of the data.

## Containers

Qlik Core is designed to utilize the power of container-based solutions and microservice architectures, such as
[Docker](https://docker.com).

The QIX Engine on Linux, provided as a Docker image, forms the foundation of this.

Developers building their solutions on Qlik Core are provided with a large range of powerful technologies, for example
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), which enables container orchestration and elastic scaling of multiple QIX Engine
instances in distributed environments.

## Live Demo

To see an example of what can be built using Qlik Core, a live demo is available at
[ca.qliktive.com](https://ca.qliktive.com).

The demo uses Qliktive as a fictive company. Qliktive provides an application to assist with drug prescriptions.

The complete demo including more detailed documentation is available as open source on GitHub in the
[qlik-ea/qliktive-custom-analytics](https://github.com/qlik-ea/qliktive-custom-analytics) repo.

## New to Qlik Core?
