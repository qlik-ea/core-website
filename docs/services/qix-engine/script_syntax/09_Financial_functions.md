## BlackAndSchole - script and chart function

The Black and Scholes model is a mathematical model for financial market derivative instruments. The formula calculates the theoretical value of an option. In Qlik Sense, the BlackAndSchole function returns the value according to the Black and Scholes unmodified formula (European style options).

`BlackAndSchole( strike , time_left , underlying_price , vol , risk_free_rate , type )`

**Return data type:** numeric

| Argument | Description|
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| strike | The future purchase price of the stock. |
|time_left | The number of time periods remaining. |
| underlying_price| The current value of the stock. |
| vol | Volatility (of the stock price) expressed as a percentage in decimal form, per time period. |
| risk_free_rate | The risk-free rate expressed as a percentage in decimal form, per time period.
| call_or_put |  'c', 'call' or any non-zero numeric value for call options. p', 'put' or 0 for put options.|

Limitations:
The value of strike, time_left, and underlying_price must be >0.
The value of vol and risk_free_rate must be: <0 or >0.

## FV - script and chart function

This function returns the future value of an investment based on
periodic, constant payments and a simple annual interest.

`FV( rate, nper, pmt [ ,pv [ , type ]] )`

**Return data type:** numeric. The result has a default number format of money.

| pv       | The present value, or lump-sum amount, that a series of future payments is worth right now. If  is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (zero).|
| type     | Should be 0 if payments are due at the end of the period and 1 if payments are due at the beginning of the period. If **type is omitted, it is assumed to be 0. |
