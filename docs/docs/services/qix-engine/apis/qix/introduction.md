# QIX API

The QIX API is the primary API used for consuming QIX documents. It is based on the WebSocket protocol and requires some
specific parameters to work correctly.

## WebSockets

Any websocket client implementation that follows the [RFC specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)
should be supported. The URL format is:

```raw
ws://<hostname>:<port>/app/<unique identifier>
```

`<unique identifier>` can be anything that would identify the document for the user making the request.

JavaScript example:

```js
const websocket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:9076/app/my-document.qvf');
```

### Headers

In a non-browser environment, most websocket client implementations support to add headers.

Header |Â Description
------ | -----------
`X-Qlik-Session: <guid>` | Defines the session id, regardless of the user. If you use this header, the websocket URL could simply be `ws://hostname:9076/app/`.
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` | If the [JWT feature](../../../../tutorials/authorization.md) is enabled, this header will identify the user and its attributes.

### Session Sharing

Qlik Associative Engine uses the concept of _sessions_ to identify the state of connections to the QIX API. When making
a new connection either a new unique session is created, or the connection gets attached to an existing session. This
makes it possible to share state, like selections, between several connections.

Session sharing can be achieved in two ways depending on whether the
[JWT feature](../../../../tutorials/authorization.md) is enabled or not:

1. If enabled, a second connection will share session if the same user connects by setting the `X-Qlik-Session` header
   to the same value as an existing session.
1. If disabled, a second connection will share session if connecting to the same document omitting the `X-Qlik-Session`
   header or setting it to the same value as an existing session.

Note that `X-Qlik-Session` can be set to a new unique identifier to delibarately force creation of a new session.

### Session Time-to-Live

It can be useful to be able to reconnect to an existing session even after the last connection to the session has been
closed. Qlik Associative Engine supports setting TTL on sessions which keeps them alive for the duration specified.

These command line switches can be used to control TTL:

Switch | Default | Description
------ | ------- | ------------
`SessionTTL` | `0` | Global TTL in seconds for all sessions. Set to `-1` for infinite TTL (requires `MaxSessionTTL=-1`). |
`MaxSessionTTL` | `1800` | Maximum TTL in seconds. TTL is always capped to this value. Set to `-1` to allow infinite TTL. |

The TTL can also be provided per connection by passing the TTL value in the URL, as in

```raw
ws://<hostname>:<port>/.../ttl/<TTL in seconds>
```

This overrides the global TTL set with `SessionTTL` and is still capped by `MaxSessionTTL`. Since different TTL values
for the same session could potentially be set, it is the latest TTL provided that is effective.

## JSONRPC Protocol

Once a session has been established using websockets, you may start interacting
using the QIX API. All requests sent from the client should contain the following:

```json
{
  // Protocol descriptor:
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  // Session-unique numeric id, referred to in the response
  // to connect the request and response:
  "id": 6,
  // The handle for the object to interact with:
  "handle": 2,
  // The object type of the handle above decides
  // which API methods you may invoke:
  "method": "ApiMethodName",
  // Parameters for the invoked API method:
  "params": {
  }
}
```

### Request and response

Here is an example request/response pair. Note that there is only _one_ static handle in
the QIX API, and that is `-1`. This handle refers to the [Global](./global.md) API.

In this example request, we will open a document using [`OpenDoc`](./global.md#opendoc).
If successful, the response will contain a reference to the document handle, which can
be used to do further requests towards the [Document](./doc.md) API, and so forth.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "handle": -1,
  "method": "OpenDoc",
  "params": {
    "qDocName": "my-document.qvf"
  }
}
```

If that document exist, the response would look similar to this:

```json
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "result": {
      "qReturn": {
        "qType": "Doc",
        "qHandle": 1,
        "qGenericId": "my-document.qvf"
      }
    },
    "change":[1]
}
```

Note that `qHandle` contains the handle we may use to make additional
requests to invoke API methods towards the document. We also get a
property on the response called `change`, this array can be added by QIX
Engine on any responses and contains all open handles in your session
that may have been invalidated and you should refetch data to ensure
your application in a valid state.
