# Hello Engine

Get started by running the Qlik Associative Engine in a Docker container on your local machine and
communicating with it using [enigma.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/enigma.js).

## Prerequisites

Clone the
[Getting Started with Web Platform](https://github.com/qlik-ea/getting-started-with-web-platform)
Git repository to your local machine. The *Hello* tutorials are located here,
and all commands should be executed from this Git repository.

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm installed on your local machine.

## Starting the Qlik Associative Engine service

1. Start the engine in a Docker container.
    Run the following command in a command shell:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    When you run this command, Docker builds the container and leaves it running in the background.
    If successful, you will see a message that creating the container is done.

1. Verify that the dockerized engine is running.

    Run the following command in a command shell:

    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```

    The `docker ps` command lists the containers that are running.
    The `-a` option lists all containers, even those that are not running.

**Note:** You can access the logs for a functional container by running the following command:

```bash
   docker logs <container-id>
```

### What is happening

When you execute the `docker-compose up` command,
Docker builds and starts a Docker container with the services configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
The `-d` option keeps the container running in the background.
In this example, Docker builds the container from the `docker-compose.yml` file,
which is located in the root folder of the getting started with web platform Git repository.
Open the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/qlik-ea/getting-started-with-web-platform/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
file to see what the compose file looks like.
It specifies how the engine runs as a Docker container, using the `qlik/engine` Docker image.

**Tip:** To learn more about Docker compose files, see [Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).

## Communicating with the Qlik Associative Engine

To communicate with the engine in a Docker container, we use a small node.js application that uses
[enigma.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/enigma.js) to retrieve the engine version number.

The application consists of the hello-engine.js file and the package-json file,
which is also shared among the Hello Data and Hello Visualization tutorials.

1. Install dependencies.

    Run the following command in a command shell:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command installs all of the dependent packages listed in the package.json file.

1. Run the application.

    Run the following command in a command shell:

    ```bash
    npm run hello-engine
    ```

    This command runs the application, which communicates with Qlik Associative Engine and retrieves the
    engine semantic version.
    If successful, you will see a response like the following:

    ```bash
    npm run hello-engine
    Creating and opening session.
    Engine version retrieved: 12.91.0
    Session closed.
    ```

    **Tip:** Open the [hello-engine.js](https://github.com/qlik-ea/getting-started-with-web-platform/blob/master/src/hello-engine/hello-engine.js)
    file to see how enigma.js is configured to communicate with the Qlik Associative Engine.

1. Stop and remove the Docker container.

    **Note:** To continue with the next tutorial, leave the Docker container running.

    Run the following command from a command shell:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

    This command stops the container and removes it.

## Next Steps

Continue with the [Hello Data](./hello-data.md) tutorial to learn how to load data into the Qlik Associative Engine.
Hello Data is a continuation of this tutorial.

**Tip:** To learn more about enigma.js,
we recommended that you take a look at [enigma.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/enigma.js) to learn about its many features.
