## What is Qlik Core?

Qlik Core is a development platform built on top of the Qlik Associative Engine.
With Qlik Core, you can take advantage of the powerful associative indexing engine from Qlik
to build your custom data exploration and data vizualization solutions.

The Qlik Associative Engine differentiates from other vendors by dynamically calculating and providing associations
based on data selections, without needing to rely on query-based analyses which are restricted to linear exploration
within a partial view of the data.

## Open Source

We believe in Open Source! Much in Qlik Core is developed as Open Source.
We encourage you to explore the different git repositories, _star_ your favorite repositories, file issues, and send
pull requests.

We are on GitHub at [Qlik - Open Source Software](https://github.com/qlik-oss/).

## Containers

Qlik Core is designed to take advantage of the power of container-based solutions and microservice architectures, such as
[Docker](https://docker.com).

The Qlik Associative Engine on Linux, provided as a Docker image, forms the foundation of this.

Developers building their solutions on Qlik Core are provided with a large range of powerful technologies, for example
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), which enables container orchestration and elastic scaling of multiple Qlik
Associative Engine instances in distributed environments.

## Use Cases

Use Cases show solutions and examples of what business scenarios that can be implemented with Qlik Core. The Use Cases
show both how data analytics problems can be addressed, and how to use Qlik Core together with different technological
platforms.

If you are looking for complete solutions to get inspiration from, or to start building your own solutions with, the Use
Cases together with our tutorials provide a good starting point.

More information can be found in the [Use Cases](./use-cases/overview.md) section.
