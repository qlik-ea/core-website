# Conventions

The service conventions are common concepts and features shared between
all services in Qlik Core.

We currently have the following conventions:

Convention                          | Description
----------------------------------- | -----------
[API Strategy](./api-strategy.md)   | How things like versioning and deprecations work.
[Logging](./logging.md)             | Conventions around logging.
[Metrics](./metrics.md)             | What run-time metadata to expose, and how to expose it.
