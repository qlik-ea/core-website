# Getting Started

## Prerequisities

### Previous Knowledge

To get started with development on Frontira, familiarity with the following is assumed:

- Pulling and handling Docker images
- Running Docker containers
- Basic Docker networking
- Basic Docker volume handling
- Basic Bash commands and scripting
- Basic Node.js and JavaScript concepts

### Software

Development is supported on both Windows and Mac. Developing on Windows requires Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise
64-bit. Developing on Mac requires OSX Yosemite 10.10.3 and above.

To start with Frontira on a developer machine, the following must be installed:

- [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows) or [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)
    - Community Edition is enough
    - Latest stable release is recommended
- Bash
    - On Windows, Git Bash in [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) is recommended

The supporting libraries, such as [enigma.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/enigma.js/) and others, are based on Node.js
so it is also recommended to install:

- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org)

Some examples make use of other technologies, such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. Some knowledge of these concepts
is also recommended, but is not required to get started with the first examples.

## Hello QIX Engine

This is _under construction_.

_One idea is to provide a super-simple example of how to pull the engine Docker image, start it with some data, hit the
health check and do simple data retrieval from it. Then, in Next Steps below, direct the reader to richer examples of
Frontira usage. Core is one step, but it is equally important to early show something visual, to catch the interest.

## Next Steps

This is _under construction_.

Yes, what are the next steps? Is it Core recipe? Not so sure. Maybe just setting up engine and using the libs to do
something visual with value before thinking about licensing, Mira, multi-node and scaling.
