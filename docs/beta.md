        Agreement. Access to and use of any other Qlik software shall be
        governed by the applicable license agreement presented during
        download or installation of that software. Qlik and Licensee are
        from time to time referred to herein as a “Party” and
        collectively as the “Parties”. The capitalized terms which are
        utilized in this Agreement are defined in the Section of this
        Agreement entitled “General”. This Agreement does not provide
        any license to use any other Qlik software or product other than
        the Qlik Core software provided hereunder.

    2.  This early release version of the Software is being provided on
        a limited basis to selected entities solely for purposes of
        testing and obtaining feedback from those entities. Qlik
        expressly disclaims any obligation or commitment to correct
        errors or discrepancies, or to continue to develop, distribute
        or support this Software or any future releases of this
        Software.

        any commercial version of the Software is installed. This
        Software is to be used solely for the purpose of testing by, and
        obtaining feedback from the Licensee, and not for any
        operational use or other commercial purpose. Any use of the
        Software pursuant to this Agreement, whether directly or
        indirectly, shall be solely for the benefit of the Licensee, and
        shall be only in object code form and otherwise solely in
        accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
        including without limitation any applicable license
        restrictions.

    4.  The installation of this Software will make registry entries and

            Licensee to Use the Software pursuant to this Agreement are
            the employees of the Licensee, and provided that, Licensee
            shall not authorize any Use or any User which is not allowed
            by the terms of this Agreement, including without
            limitation, any license restrictions.

    2.  <span class="underline">Assignment</span>. Licensee shall have
        no right to transfer or assign, in whole or in part, this
        Agreement, the license(s) granted herein, or any of its other
        rights and obligations under this Agreement. For purposes of
        this Section, any change of control of Licensee, whether by
        merger, sale of equity interests, or otherwise, will constitute
        an assignment. Any attempt by Licensee to assign this Agreement,
        the license(s) granted herein, or any of its other rights and
        obligations hereunder in violation of this Section will be null
        and void, and will constitute a material breach of this
        Agreement. Qlik is free to assign or transfer any or all of its
        rights or obligations under this Agreement at its discretion.
        All terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
        benefit of, and be enforceable by and against the respective
        successors and permitted assigns of Qlik and Licensee.

    3.  <span class="underline">Third Party Materials</span>. The
        Software may include certain third party software, data, or
        other materials which are separately licensed by their
        respective owners (“Third Party Materials”). Any licenses or
        restrictions contained in this Agreement do not alter any rights
        or obligations Licensee may have under the terms associated with
        the Third Party Materials. Such terms and information relating
        to the Third Party Materials may be found in such Third Party
        Materials, within the Documentation or on the web page

        with any licenses, obligations, attribution, restrictions and
        disclaimers that may be necessary to use the Third Party
        Materials. ANY USE OF THE THIRD PARTY MATERIALS ARE SUBJECT TO
        SUCH THIRD PARTY LICENSE TERMS, WHICH ARE INCORPORTATED IN THIS
        LICENSE AGREEMENT BY REFERENCE AND SHALL BE APPLICABLE SOLEY
        WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD PARTY MATERIALS WITH WHICH THEY ARE
        ASSOCIATED. QLIK MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR OTHER
        COMMITMENT REGARDING SUCH THIRD PARTY MATERIALS. QLIK HEREBY
        DISCLAIMS, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY AND ALL
        LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO LICENSEE’S REPRODUCTION AND/OR USE OF
        ANY THIRD PARTY MATERIALS.

    4.  <span class="underline">Entire Agreement</span>. This Agreement
        constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with
        respect to the use of the Software, and supersedes all previous
        agreements, representations, warranties, statements,
        negotiations, understandings and undertakings, whether verbal or
        written, pertaining to such subject matter. The Licensee hereby
        represents and acknowledges that in entering into this
        Agreement, it did not rely on any representations or warranties
        other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement.

    5.  <span class="underline">Compliance with Laws</span>. Licensee
        agrees at all times to comply with applicable laws and
        regulations in its performance of this Agreement, including
        without limitation the export control laws, as they may be
        amended from time to time.

    6.  <span class="underline">Governing Law and Jurisdiction</span>.
        The English version of this Agreement will be the version used
        when interpreting or construing these terms and conditions.
        Language translations of the Agreement, if any, are provided for
        convenience only. This Agreement will not be governed by the
        conflict of law rules of any jurisdiction or the United Nations
        Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the
        application of which are expressly excluded. This Agreement will
        be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive
        laws in force in Sweden. Any dispute arising out of or in
        connection with the agreement, including any question regarding
        its existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to
        and finally resolved by Arbitration at the Arbitration Institute
        of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm. Where the
        amount in dispute clearly does not exceed EUR 100,000, the
        Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (SCC) Institute’s Rules for
        Expedited Arbitration shall apply and the arbitral tribunal
        shall be composed of a sole arbitrator. Where the amount in
        dispute clearly exceeds the amount set forth above, the Rules of
        the SCC Institute shall apply and the arbitral tribunal shall be
        composed of three arbitrators. The language to be used in the
        arbitral proceedings shall, unless otherwise agreed, be English.
        Qlik reserves the right to enforce any judgment or award which
        is obtained in any jurisdiction appropriate for such
        enforcement.

    7.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, Qlik or
        Licensee may request any judicial, administrative, or other
        authority to order any provisional or conservatory measure,
        including injunctive relief, specific performance, or other
        equitable relief, prior to the institution of legal or
        arbitration proceedings, or during the proceedings, for the
        preservation of its rights and interests or to enforce specific
        terms that are suitable for provisional remedies. In addition
        and without affecting any other rights or remedies that Qlik may
        have, the Licensee acknowledges that Qlik may be irreparably
        harmed by any breach of the terms of this Agreement including
        but not limited to breach of obligations with respect to Qlik
        Confidential Information or violation of any of Qlik’s
        Intellectual Property Rights and that damages alone may not
        necessarily be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the Licensee
        hereby acknowledges, that except as provided in this Agreement,
        without proof of actual damages that injunctive relief, specific
        performance or other equitable relief in favor of the Licensee
        is an appropriate and necessary remedy for breach of the terms
        of this Agreement.

    8.  <span class="underline">Audit</span>. During the term of this
        Agreement and for a one year period thereafter, Qlik may audit,
        upon reasonable notice to Licensee and at Qlik’s expense,
        Licensee’s relevant records to determine Licensee’s compliance
        with this Agreement. In the event that any such audit reveals
        that the Licensee has breached any material obligation
        hereunder, then, in addition to any other remedies as Qlik may
        have, Licensee shall reimburse to Qlik the cost of the audit.

    9.  <span class="underline">Notices</span>. All notices or other
        communications to Qlik shall be addressed to: QlikTech
        International Markets AB, Scheelevägen 24-26; SE-223 63 Lund,
        Sweden; ATTENTION: LEGAL DEPARTMENT, with a copy to General
        Counsel, QlikTech Inc., 150 N. Radnor-Chester Rd. – Suite E220,
        Radnor, PA 19087.

    10. <span class="underline">Severability/Waiver</span>. If any
        provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, that
        provision shall be construed, limited, modified or, if
        necessary, severed to the extent necessary to eliminate its
        invalidity or unenforceability, and the other provisions of this
        Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any term which
        refers to a legal concept or process which exists in one
        jurisdiction shall be deemed to include a reference to the
        equivalent or analogous concept or process in any other
        jurisdiction in which this Agreement may apply or to the laws of
        which a Party may be or become subject. No term of this
        Agreement shall be deemed waived and no breach or default
        excused unless such waiver or excuse shall be in writing and
        signed by the Party issuing the same.

    11. <span class="underline">Limitation to bring Action.</span> No
        action, regardless of form, arising out of this Agreement may be
        brought by Licensee more than one (1) year after the cause of
        action arose.

    12. <span class="underline">Non-Waivable Rights</span>. Nothing
        included in this Agreement shall limit any non-waivable right to
        decompile the Software that the Licensee may enjoy under
        mandatory law. For example, if the Licensee is located in the
        European Union (EU), Licensee may have the right upon certain
        conditions specified to decompile the Software if it is
        necessary to do so in order to achieve interoperability of the
        Software with another software program, and the Licensee has
        first asked Qlik in writing to provide the information necessary
        to achieve such interoperability and Qlik has not made such
        information available. In addition, such decompilation may only
        be done by the Licensee. Qlik has the right to impose reasonable
        conditions before providing such information. Any information
        supplied by Qlik or obtained by Licensee, as permitted
        hereunder, may only be used by the Licensee for the purpose
        described herein and may not be disclosed to any third party or
        used to create any software which is substantially similar to
        the expression of the Software or used for any other act which
        infringes Qlik’s or its licensors’ copyright.

    13. <span class="underline">Marketing.</span> During the term of
        this Agreement, Licensee shall use endeavor to:

<!-- -->

1.  Provide Qlik with applicable quotes for use by Qlik (including in
    press releases) and allow Qlik to prepare and publicly distribute
    such quotes and press releases;

2.  Participate in media opportunities, including those involving
    interviews, that may be used by Qlik for marketing purposes;

3.  Participate in calls or face-to-face meetings to share details of
    the Qlik Core experience and or participate in analyst
    events/surveys;

4.  Participate in calls with current or prospective Qlik customers
    and/or partners to promote successful Qlik Core testing and
    development experience; and

5.  Allow Qlik to prepare a case study related to the Licensee’s use of
    the Software and distribute this internally within Qlik and
    externally including on Qlik.com, Qlik collateral and Qlik
    newsletters.
