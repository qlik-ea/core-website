# Deploying to Nomad

**NOTE**: Deploying to Nomad is not officially supported by Frontira.

It is assumed that there is already a Nomad environment set up. If you would like to setup a local enviroment follow the [Install Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) guide.

## Secrets

Since the Docker images being used are not public you have to pass Docker credentials when deploying the Nomad stack. In this example we use the Docker auths that is stored when logging into docker hub i.e. `docker login`.

Be aware that the Docker credentials are stored in plain text in Nomad, see [here](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker.html#docker-auth-config). In [nomad.hcl](https://github.com/qlik-ea/core/blob/master/nomad/nomad.hcl) there is an example of how the Nomad client can be configured to use local docker credentials.

## Service Discovery

Mira uses the DNS mode for service discovery in a Nomad orchestration. This assumes that there is a running Consul server in the Nomad environment. Nomad will automatically register services in Consul when deploying the `nomad` files. The hostname that Mira should use for discovering QIX Engine instances is defined in the task configuration for [Mira](https://github.com/qlik-ea/core/blob/master/nomad/mira.nomad).

## Deploy

Deploy the core stack with the following commands:

```sh
$ nomad run ./nomad/mira.nomad
$ nomad run ./nomad/license-service.nomad
$ nomad run ./nomad/engine.nomad
```
