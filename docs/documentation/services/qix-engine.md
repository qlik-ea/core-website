# QIX Engine documentation

This page contains documentation on a subset of the QIX Engine features that are commonly used in a containerized environment.

## Logging

The QIX Engine follows the logging format and levels specified in the [Frontira Service Contract](../contract.md#logging).

### Log Types

The QIX Engine uses different log types depending on the category of the log event.
Each of these log types can have individual log verbosity as described in [log levels](#log-levels),
and can be toggled depending on scenario.
Below is a list of the different log types that are available and the default verbosity level for each.

| Type | Description | CLI parameter | Default verbosity level |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| System | All _standard_ debug messages | SystemLogVerbosity | 4 |
| Performance | Performance log, typically containing metrics e.g. NbrActiveUsers and CPULoad | PerformanceLogVerbosity | 4 |
| Audit | User based detailed logging e.g. when the user makes a selection in a doc | AuditLogVerbosity | 0 |
| Session |  Information about a client session e.g. user, machine id, ip-address, port | SessionLogVerbosity | 4 |
| Traffic | JSON traffic to and from the QIX Engine | TrafficLogVerbosity | 0 |
| QixPerformance | QIX protocol performance | QixPerformanceLogVerbosity | 0 |
| SmartSearchQuery | Smart Search query log | SmartSearchQueryLogVerbosity | 3 |
| SmartSearchIndex | Smart Search index log | SmartSearchIndexLogVerbosity | 3 |
| SSE | Server Side Extension log | SSELogVerbosity | 4 |

### Log Levels

Configuration of the log levels is done by providing settings through command line parameters when starting the docker container.

!!! note
    The QIX Engine uses the [log levels](../contract.md#logging-levels) defined in the _Frontira Service Contract_,
    but each log level is also mapped to a numeric value used to set the verbosity level of QIX Engine logging.

| Log level | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| OFF (disabled) | 0 |
| FATAL | 1 |
| ERROR | 2 |
| WARNING | 3 |
| INFO | 4 |
| DEBUG | 5 |

An example of how to set the `System` log verbosity to `DEBUG` in a `docker-compose` file.

```yaml
version: "3.1"

services:
  qix-engine:
    image: qlikea/engine
    command: -S SystemLogVerbosity=5
    labels:
      qix-engine: ""
      ...
```

### Log Format

In addition to the required fields in the _Frontira Service Contract_ the QIX Engine also has a few log fields that
are common to all log types:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| user_id | Current active user |
| log_type | Type of log, one of the following [types](#log-types) |
| thread_id | Thread identifier |

Apart from the common fields some of the log types contain additional fields,
and the fields are listed below in separate sections.
