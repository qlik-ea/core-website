# Qlik Core Service Contract

This document contains a contract for Qlik Core services to keep the services aligned in aspects such as
logging formats, health checks, and metrics.

## Logging

Services must log enough information for a developer to be able to debug and fix issues using the information
available in the logs.
In general, developers will not have access to production environments to debug services, but instead rely on
real-time historical logs for analysis.
A service's logs are the main visibility into the behavior of the service.
A service should not concern itself with the routing, storage, or aggregation of its logs.
A service should also not attempt to write to or manage log files.
Instead a service should write its logs to `stdout`
and make sure that the content of the logs is sufficient for monitoring and fixing issues.
In staging and production environments, each service's log output will be captured by the execution environment
and aggregated in near real-time.

### Logging conventions

1. Write events only on `stdout`; never write events to files.
    * Events _must_ be on `stdout` and not `stderr`.
    * It is _not_ the job of the service to store, transmit, or buffer log events.
    * During local development, the developer will view the service's event stream in their terminal or console,
      or manually redirect (with a pipe or similar) to a local file.
    * When the service is deployed,
      it is the responsibility of the execution environment to capture and direct logs appropriately for later analysis.
1. Events must be written as valid JSON, with the following minimum standard fields:

    | Field | Description | Requirements |
    | ----- | ----------- | ------------ |
    | `timestamp` | The date/time that the event occurred at. | <ul><li>The system clock must be set for the UTC 00:00 timezone (a.k.a _Zulu_), and events must be logged in this timezone.</li><li>Timestamps must be formatted in the RFC3339 format _with fractional seconds_: `2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z`</li><li>Not all systems will report fractions of a second at the same precision&mdash;it doesn't matter whether this is provided at millisecond or nanosecond precision, as long as it's provided.</li></ul> |
    | `message` | A message describing the event. | <ul><li>The message _should not_ contain metadata. Any metadata about the event should be presented in seperate fields.</li></ul> |
    | `logseverity` | String value indicating the level of importance of the log message. | <ul><li>The `logseverity` specified in the log _must_ be one of the following values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR` or `FATAL`. The definition of each level is further described [here](#logging-levels).</li></ul> |

1. Additional fields will be required in specific contexts,
  and should be coordinated between services so that analysis can be correctly aggregated across different services.
  For example, if multiple services track session IDs, they should agree on a common field name, such as `session_id`.
  Case and word separation style must be consistent. The _snake_case_ style is preferred
 (e.g., use `session_id`, _not_ `SessionId`)

### Logging Levels

The allowed log levels are as follows:

* `TRACE`
    * Fine-grained debug message, typically used to capture a flow of events.
* `DEBUG`
    * Mostly used for debugging purposes.
    * Typically not enabled by default in production.
* `INFO`
    * Normal operations of the service that should be logged.
    * Indicates some important operation or state in the service.
* `WARN`
    * Indicates an event or state that was not part of common operations, but was handled.
    * An event that potentially can become an error.
    * An event that does not prevent correct operation of the system from an end-user perspective.
* `ERROR`
    * An error that was not handled and was unexpected to the service.
    * Service can continue normal operation after error recovery.
* `FATAL`
    * Non-recoverable error that forces the service to terminate.
