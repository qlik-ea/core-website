# Data Connector GRPC API

In order to allow any kind of data to be fed into QIX Engine each data source is abstracted by a connector. A connector
is typically implemented as a stateless docker container sitting between QIX Engine and the data source.

``` asciiart
+-------------+              +-------------+                +-------------+
| QIX Engine  | --GetData--> |  Connector  | -------------> | Data Source |
|             | <----------  |             | <------------  |             |
+-------------+              +-------------+                +-------------+
```

The role of the connector is to translate the APIs and formats of a data source into a format that QIX Engine
understands - namely the [Data Connector GRPC API](data-connector-grpc-api.proto).

## Configuring connectors

There are several ways in which QIX Engine can discover available connectors, where using the GrpcConnectorPlugins settings
is the simplest one.

## The GetData function

When data is loaded QIX Engine sends on grpc call - `GetData` - is sent for each table being loaded.

``` proto
rpc GetData(GetDataOptions) returns(stream DataChunk) {}
```

The input to the call is a structure that contains among other things a connection string, username, password, and a
query statement. The format of the connection string and query are connector specific. The input structure can for
instance look like this:

``` proto
{
    connection: {
        connectionString: 'hostname=localhost',
        user: 'test',
        password: 'test'
    },
    parameters: {
        statement: '{ "collection": "airports" }',
    }
}
```

## Output

The `GetData` call returns a stream of data chunks. This allows a connector to stream data from the data source to
QIX Engine while translating the data piece by piece. In addition to the actual data stream the connector also has to
supply a GRPC header `x-qlik-getdata-bin` with metadata.

### Data chunks

One would expect that a data chunk would contain a set of rows but in fact the data is sent column by column where
each column holds the corresponding column values for a all rows in the chunk. The reason for this is simply
performance. All values in a specific column share the same format which allows GRPC (and hence protobuf) to encode
the data more efficiently. To further improve the performance each column can choose from a variety of formats -
strings, floating point numbers, and integers. Along with the column data a structure called `ValueFlag` is used to
further specify the format of the data. This is for instance used to specify date formats etc.

``` proto
message DataChunk {
  repeated Column cols = 1;
}
```

``` proto
message Column {
    repeated string strings = 1;
    repeated double doubles = 2;
    repeated sint64 integers = 3;
    repeated ValueFlag flags = 4;
}
```

### Metadata

The metadata sent in the `x-qlik-getdata-bin` header is the `GetDataResponse` message encoded using _protobuf_ which
is the underlying encoding technology in GRPC.

``` proto
message GetDataResponse {
    repeated FieldInfo fieldInfo = 1;
    string tableName = 2;
}
```
