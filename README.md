# Frontira Information

This is the top-level repo containing general information, concepts, specifications, examples, and links to other useful resources.

## Terminology

Terminology used can be found in [Terminology](./docs/terminology.md).

## Deliverables

Frontira consists of different deliverables:

- Use cases
- Recipes
- Core components
- Custom Qliktive components

### Use Cases

A fictive company, called **Qliktive**, implements solutions on top of this project. These solutions realize different use cases that leverage the power of the QIX Engine and are used as our showcases. Each Qliktive use case is developed in a repo of its own.

Currently, this use case is provided:

- [Custom Analytics UI](./docs/use-cases/use-case-custom-analytics/README.md)

### Recipes

A recipe typically answers a question of the form "_How do I ...?_". It is a way to describe important concepts in more isolation.

One example can be: _How do I load my own data into QIX Engine?_

More information on recipes is provided in the [Recipes Overview](./docs/recipes-overview.md).

### Core Components

These are the core packages and microservices. They are typically available as ready-to-use Docker images. These components are developed to be generic and with the intention to be used in most solutions. Some of these components are available as open source, some are not.

- [QIX Engine](https://hub.docker.com/r/qlikea/engine/) - The powerful associative indexing engine from Qlik.
- [License Service](https://hub.docker.com/r/qlikea/license-service/) - License service required to run QIX Engine.
- [Mira](https://hub.docker.com/r/qlikea/mira/) - The QIX Engine discovery service, https://github.com/qlik-ea/mira

There are also several open source web-development libraries that are useful when working with Frontira:

- [enigma.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/enigma.js/) - Communication with QIX Engine.
- [halyard.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/halyard.js) - Simplifies data loading into the QIX Engine.
- [after-work.js](https://github.com/qlik-oss/after-work.js) - Provides a unified testing framework for different test levels.
- [picasso.js](https://github.com/qlik-trial/picasso.js) - Charting library streamlined for building visualizations on top of QIX Engine.

### Custom Qliktive Components

These components are packages and microservices that are developed specifically for a certain Qliktive use case. As such, they are not generally re-usable between different solutions. The idea is rather to provide examples and with some parts that can be further built upon for any new solution. Each such component is developed in a separate repo.

Since these components are more of example implementations, they do not come with the same level of support from Qlik as the core Components described above.

We use the prefix `qliktive-` to make it clear that these components are specific for Qliktive use cases.

## Testing Strategy

Components, microservices, and the example use case implementations are subject to the [Testing Strategy](./docs/testing-strategy.md).
